Laravel API - backedn and API client. This is a working template for Laravel API. You can use it in your project. 
# From the beggining
The question is, why do we use API for Web pages/applications?

## In the old days
In the old days all web pages where designed and created in a similar way. At the bottom the was a SQL to keep the data, then there was a HTTP server with PHP. The PHP scripts was making a direct requests to the database. Upss... One wrong SQL and you can have a problem.

# Problems to solve
## Data integrity
Due the the fact that API requests are defined, and you are unable to make a makeup request, what you could do having a direct access to the database, your data should be safe from data integrity issues.
## Buissnes logic
Buissness provides logic to the applications.
## Perfromance
## User access rights
